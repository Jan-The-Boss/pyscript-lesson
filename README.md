# PyScript Lesson

## Description:
PyScript is a tool that allows you to run python in the browser. This repository contains a demo application that has one working tool, and two tools that you will need to implement. The tool that is implemented allows the user to get the current date and time. 

## Task 1:
Modify the code such that there is a new method added to the App class, that returns a random number between 1 and 100. Then link this to the "getRandomButton" button.

## Task 2:
Add functionality to the last section of the page in a similar fashion to task 1. However, this time use the two number inputs to allow the user to select a range of values from which the random number will be selected.
